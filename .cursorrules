### Code Style Standards
**ALWAYS** follow the code style rules defined in `@~/.agent-os/standards/code-style.md`:
- TypeScript 5 for all runtime code
- Functional components with hooks
- 2 spaces indentation, 100 chars soft max
- PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions
- Prettier + ESLint (airbnb + @typescript-eslint)
- Vitest + jsdom for unit tests, Cypress for e2e

### Best Practices Standards
**ALWAYS** follow the best practices defined in `@~/.agent-os/standards/best-practices.md`:
- Mobile-first & accessible by default (≤400px xs breakpoint)
- Keep it simple, steady & secure
- DRY, types first
- Cloud-native, container-first
- Observability with Spring Boot Actuator + Prometheus
- Unit ≥80% branch coverage, static analysis

### Architecture Standards
**ALWAYS** follow the layered architecture pattern:
- Controller → Service → Repository pattern
- Clear separation of concerns
- JPA/Hibernate with PostgreSQL
- Spring Security with OAuth 2.1
- OpenTelemetry 1.28 + OTLP/HTTP exporter

## Available Rules

### 1. Analyze Product
Use when you need to analyze the current codebase and understand the project structure.
Reference: `.cursor/rules/analyze-product.mdc`

### 2. Plan Product
Use when planning a new product or major feature from concept to implementation.
Reference: `.cursor/rules/plan-product.mdc`

### 3. Create Specification
Use when creating detailed technical specifications for new features.
Reference: `.cursor/rules/create-spec.mdc`

### 4. Execute Tasks
Use when implementing the next task in the development workflow.
Reference: `.cursor/rules/execute-tasks.mdc`

## Code Generation Rules

### Backend Code (Java/Spring Boot)

### AI/ML Code
**ALWAYS** follow these patterns:
- Use OpenAI GPT-4o for natural language processing
- Use pgvector for vector embeddings
- Use LangChain 0.2 for AI application development
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Use async/await patterns for AI operations

## Development Process

### Before Writing Code
1. **ALWAYS** check `@~/.agent-os/standards/tech-stack.md` for technology choices
2. **ALWAYS** check `@~/.agent-os/standards/code-style.md` for coding conventions
3. **ALWAYS** check `@~/.agent-os/standards/best-practices.md` for architectural patterns
4. **ALWAYS** verify compliance with Agent OS standards

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow consistent coding conventions from standards
- Write comprehensive tests (≥80% branch coverage)
- Ensure proper error handling and edge case coverage
- Document all public APIs and interfaces
- Maintain backward compatibility where required
- Use static analysis tools (SonarQube, ESLint, Checkstyle)

### Architecture Principles
- Design for scalability and maintainability
- Follow separation of concerns (Controller → Service → Repository)
- Implement proper logging and monitoring (SLF4J + Prometheus)
- Consider security implications in all decisions (Spring Security)
- Plan for performance from the start (connection pooling, caching)

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all new functionality (vitest + jsdom)
- Implement integration tests for critical paths
- Perform security testing for new features
- Conduct performance testing for scalability
- Use Testcontainers for integration testing

### Deployment and Operations
- Follow secure deployment practices (Docker 24, multi-stage builds)
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Plan for rollback procedures
- Document operational procedures
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Error Handling and Logging
- Use consistent, detailed logging format (SLF4J)
- Include all necessary details for debugging
- Implement proper error handling throughout the application
- Log security events and performance metrics
- Use structured logging with proper log levels

## Security Standards
- Use Spring Security with OAuth 2.1
- Implement proper input validation
- Use HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Follow OWASP Top-10 counter-measures
- Use Helmet in React for security headers
- Implement rate limiting and request validation

## Performance Standards
- TTI ≤ 2s on LTE for frontend
- P95 backend ≤ 200ms
- Use Redis for caching
- Implement proper database indexing
- Use connection pooling
- Monitor with Prometheus v2.50 + Grafana 11

## Documentation Requirements
- Maintain current architecture documentation
- Document all configuration and setup procedures
- Create user guides and API documentation
- Keep README files updated
- Document deployment and operational procedures
- Use JavaDoc for public APIs, TSDoc for exported TypeScript

## Standards Enforcement

### Mandatory Compliance
- **NEVER** deviate from Agent OS standards without explicit approval
