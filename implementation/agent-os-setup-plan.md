# Agent OS Setup Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Agent OS is a system for better planning and executing software development tasks with AI agents. It provides structured workflows, standards, and instructions to transform AI coding agents into productive developers.

**Repository**: https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os/
**Documentation**: https://buildermethods.com/agent-os

## Phase 1: Project Analysis and Research ✅

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Cloned Agent OS repository
- [x] Analyzed project structure
- [x] Reviewed setup scripts and documentation
- [x] Identified installation requirements

### Project Structure Analysis:

```

## Phase 2: Environment Setup and Installation ✅

### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Install Agent OS base system
- [x] Configure Cursor integration
- [x] Set up project-specific configuration
- [x] Create architecture documentation

### Installation Steps:
1. **Base Installation**: ✅ Installed core files to ~/.agent-os/
2. **Cursor Integration**: ✅ Created Cursor commands in .cursor/rules/
3. **Customization**: ✅ Set up project-specific configuration
4. **Testing**: ✅ Verified installation and functionality

## Phase 3: Configuration and Customization

### Tasks:
- [ ] Review and customize coding standards
- [ ] Configure tech stack specifications
- [ ] Set up project-specific instructions
- [ ] Create logging and monitoring structure

### Key Configuration Areas:
- **Standards**: Code style, best practices, tech stack
- **Instructions**: Core workflows, task execution, product analysis
- **Commands**: Cursor integration commands for AI assistance

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

### Tasks:
- [ ] Test Agent OS commands in Cursor
- [ ] Verify file installation and permissions
- [ ] Test core workflows and instructions
- [ ] Validate integration with AI coding tools

## Phase 5: Documentation and Knowledge Base

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create architecture document
- [ ] Document setup process and configuration
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Set up implementation tracking

## Implementation Notes

### System Requirements:
- Windows 10/11 (current: Windows 10.0.26100)
- PowerShell environment
- Git for repository management
- Cursor IDE for integration

### Installation Path:
- Base files: `~/.agent-os/`
- Cursor rules: `.cursor/rules/`
- Project-specific: Current workspace

### Available Commands (after setup):
- `@plan-product` - Initiate Agent OS in new product codebase
- `@analyze-product` - Initiate Agent OS in existing product codebase
- `@create-spec` - Initiate new feature development
- `@execute-tasks` - Build and ship code

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Execute base installation script
2. ✅ Configure Cursor integration
3. ✅ Customize standards for project needs
4. ✅ Test and validate setup
5. ✅ Document architecture and configuration

## Current Status
Agent OS has been successfully installed and configured! The system is ready for use.

### Available Commands in Cursor:
- `@plan-product` - Initiate Agent OS in a new product's codebase
- `@analyze-product` - Initiate Agent OS in an existing product's codebase
- `@create-spec` - Initiate a new feature (or simply ask 'what's next?')
- `@execute-tasks` - Build and ship code

### Installation Locations:
- **Standards**: `~/.agent-os/standards/`
- **Instructions**: `~/.agent-os/instructions/`
- **Cursor Commands**: `.cursor/rules/`

### Next Actions:
1. Test the Agent OS commands in Cursor
2. Customize standards and instructions as needed
3. Begin using Agent OS for development workflows
