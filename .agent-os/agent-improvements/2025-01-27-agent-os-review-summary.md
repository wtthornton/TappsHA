### 2. Architecture Assessment Lessons
**File**: `categories/architecture/2025-01-27-agent-os-architecture-assessment-lessons.md`

**Key Insights**:
- Standards vs. Practice Gap: Standards must be enforced through automated tools
- Modular Design Excellence: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- Error Handling Sophistication: Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- Documentation Quality: Well-documented processes and standards

### 3. Testing Infrastructure Lessons
**File**: `categories/testing/2025-01-27-agent-os-testing-infrastructure-lessons.md`

**Key Insights**:
- Testing Infrastructure Importance: Sophisticated tools require comprehensive testing
- Test Utilities Value: Robust utilities improve test development speed and reliability
- Coverage vs. Quality Balance: 80% coverage provides good balance
- Error Testing Importance: Testing error scenarios is crucial for reliability

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Development environment setup (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest)
- Testing infrastructure with comprehensive test utilities
- Code quality tools and automated formatting
- Lessons learned documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues
- TypeScript compilation errors (103 errors across 6 files)
- Code style violations (944 linting issues)
- Duplicate exports and interface conflicts
- Unused variables and imports

### üîÑ Next Steps
1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**: Resolve compilation errors to enable proper development
2. **Run Auto-Fix**: Use `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix style issues
3. **Update Standards**: Enhance development standards documentation
4. **Complete Testing**: Add tests for all remaining modules

## Impact Assessment

### High Impact Improvements
- **Development Velocity**: Proper tooling will significantly improve development speed
- **Code Quality**: Automated checks will prevent quality issues from reaching production
