# Spec Summary (Lite)

Deliver developer‑experience upgrades for Agent OS: a fast onboarding doctor command, cross‑platform execution via a unified shell, faster validators with intelligent skipping and caching, documentation consistency guardrails, and a clearer internal dashboard with actionable links. Keep the stack simple (Node 18+, vanilla JS, Markdown), target <30s compliance runs, and auto‑generate required companion docs when creating new specs.
