# Development Best Practices

## Mobile-First & Responsive
- Prioritize small screens first; responsive layouts for all viewports.
- Optimize for fast mobile load times (LCP, TTI) and intuitive navigation.

## Observability by Design
- Integrate logging, metrics, and tracing early using OpenTelemetry.
- Define key KPIs, dashboards, and alerts during initial design.

## DRY, KISS & 12-Factor
- Follow DRY and KISS principles; avoid redundant logic.
- Adopt 12-Factor App practices for scalability and portability.
- Ensure separation of concerns and SOLID design for modularity.

## Performance & Fail-Fast
- Validate inputs early and fail fast on errors.
- Incorporate caching and asynchronous processing where appropriate.
- Plan for fault tolerance (circuit breakers, retries) and scalability.

## DevOps & Agile
- Treat CI/CD and Infrastructure-as-Code as core development practices.
- Maintain environment parity and continuous feedback loops.
