> Spec: Assisted Automation Creation Frontend Implementation
> Created: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive React frontend for the Assisted Automation Creation feature that provides an intuitive, AI-powered interface for users to create, validate, and manage Home Assistant automations. This frontend will integrate with the existing backend API and provide real-time feedback, template selection, and automation validation capabilities.

## User Stories

### Automation Suggestion Interface

As a Home Assistant user, I want to input my automation requirements in natural language, so that I can receive AI-powered suggestions for automation configurations that match my needs.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User navigates to the automation creation page
2. User enters their automation requirements in a text input field
3. System displays real-time suggestions with confidence scores
4. User can select, modify, or reject suggestions
5. System provides detailed explanations for each suggestion

### Template-Based Creation

As a user, I want to browse and select from pre-built automation templates, so that I can quickly create common automations without starting from scratch.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User accesses the templates section
2. System displays categorized templates (lighting, security, climate, etc.)
3. User can preview template details and requirements
4. User selects a template and customizes parameters
5. System validates the configuration before creation

### Automation Validation and Testing

As a user, I want to validate my automation configuration before deployment, so that I can identify and fix potential issues before they affect my Home Assistant setup.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User configures automation parameters
2. System performs real-time validation checks
3. User receives detailed feedback on potential issues
4. System suggests fixes and improvements
5. User can test automation logic before deployment

## Spec Scope

1. **Automation Suggestion Interface** - React component for natural language input and AI suggestion display
2. **Template Browser** - Component for browsing and selecting automation templates
3. **Automation Builder** - Drag-and-drop interface for creating custom automations
4. **Validation Dashboard** - Real-time validation and testing interface
5. **History and Feedback** - Component for viewing automation history and providing feedback

## Out of Scope

- Mobile application development (deferred to later phase)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (separate feature)
- Real-time automation monitoring (covered by existing EventMonitoringDashboard)
- User management and authentication (handled by existing LoginForm)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete React frontend with all automation creation components integrated into the main application
2. Real-time integration with backend API endpoints for suggestions, validation, and creation
3. Responsive design that works on desktop and tablet devices with intuitive user experience
