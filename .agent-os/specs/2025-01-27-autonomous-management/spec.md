# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Autonomous Management System
> Created: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Implement autonomous automation management capabilities that allow TappHA to automatically create, modify, and retire Home Assistant automations with comprehensive user approval workflows and safety mechanisms. This system will enable truly intelligent home automation management while maintaining complete user control and transparency.

## User Stories

### Assisted Automation Creation

As a Home Assistant power user, I want TappHA to automatically create new automations based on my household patterns and preferences, so that I can benefit from intelligent automation suggestions without losing control over my system.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. TappHA analyzes household patterns and identifies automation opportunities
2. System generates automation suggestions with detailed explanations
3. User reviews suggestions with full transparency into AI reasoning
4. User can modify, approve, or reject each suggestion
5. Approved automations are created with comprehensive backup and rollback capabilities

### Automation Lifecycle Management

As a Home Assistant administrator, I want TappHA to manage the complete lifecycle of automations from creation to retirement, so that my automation system remains optimized and relevant without manual intervention.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System continuously monitors automation performance and effectiveness
2. Identifies underperforming or obsolete automations
3. Suggests optimizations or retirement with detailed reasoning
4. User approves changes with full audit trail
5. System implements changes with automatic backup and rollback capabilities

### User Approval Workflow

As a cautious Home Assistant user, I want explicit approval for all significant automation changes while allowing routine optimizations to proceed autonomously, so that I maintain control while benefiting from intelligent automation management.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System categorizes changes by significance and risk level
2. Significant changes require explicit user approval
3. Routine optimizations proceed with user-defined limits
4. All changes are logged with comprehensive audit trails
5. Emergency stop capability for immediate rollback

## Spec Scope

1. **Assisted Automation Creation** - AI-powered automation generation with user modification capabilities and comprehensive validation
2. **Automation Lifecycle Management** - Complete lifecycle handling from creation to retirement using Spring Boot workflow engine
3. **User Approval Workflow** - Require explicit approval for significant changes while handling routine optimizations autonomously
4. **Configuration Backup System** - Maintain backup of automation configurations before making changes with rollback capabilities
5. **Real-Time Optimization** - Continuously monitor and optimize existing automations using Spring Boot async processing
6. **Adaptive Learning** - Improve recommendations based on user feedback and system performance
7. **Proactive Pattern Detection** - Identify shifts in household patterns and recommend adjustments using AI models
8. **Emergency Stop System** - Instant disable of AI features with complete rollback and safety mechanisms
9. **Audit Trail System** - Comprehensive logging of all AI actions with explanations and compliance support
10. **Granular Control System** - User-defined safety limits and approval requirements based on control preferences

## Out of Scope

- **Voice Integration** - Voice commands for automation management (Phase 4 feature)
- **Mobile Application** - Progressive web app for mobile automation management (Phase 4 feature)
- **Multi-Household Learning** - Cross-household pattern recognition and optimization (Phase 4 feature)
- **Advanced NLP capabilities** - Natural language processing for automation creation (Phase 4 feature)
- **Predictive Automation** - AI models to anticipate user needs and create automations proactively (Phase 4 feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Autonomous Automation Management System** - Fully functional system that can create, modify, and retire automations with user approval workflows
2. **Comprehensive Safety Framework** - Emergency stop system, audit trails, and granular user control mechanisms
3. **Real-Time Optimization Engine** - Continuous monitoring and optimization of existing automations with performance tracking
