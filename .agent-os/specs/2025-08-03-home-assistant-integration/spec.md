# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Home Assistant Integration
> Created: 2025-08-03

## Overview

Implement secure Home Assistant API and WebSocket integration using Spring Boot REST client to establish the foundational connection for TappHA's intelligent automation management system. This integration will enable real-time monitoring of Home Assistant events and provide the data foundation for advanced pattern recognition and automation optimization.

## User Stories

### Secure Connection Establishment

As a TappHA system administrator, I want to securely connect to my Home Assistant instance using long-lived access tokens, so that TappHA can monitor and analyze my home automation data without compromising security.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Administrator provides Home Assistant URL and long-lived access token
2. System validates connection and token permissions
3. System establishes persistent connection with proper error handling
4. System logs successful connection and begins monitoring

### Real-Time Event Monitoring

As a TappHA user, I want TappHA to monitor all Home Assistant state changes and events in real-time, so that the system can build comprehensive behavioral patterns for intelligent automation recommendations.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. System connects to Home Assistant WebSocket API
2. System subscribes to state_changed events and other relevant event streams
3. System processes and stores event data in PostgreSQL and InfluxDB
4. System maintains connection with automatic reconnection on failures

### Configuration Management

As a TappHA administrator, I want to securely store and manage Home Assistant connection credentials, so that the system can maintain persistent access while following security best practices.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Administrator provides connection details through secure configuration interface
2. System encrypts and stores credentials using Spring Boot configuration management
3. System validates stored credentials on startup
4. System provides secure credential rotation capabilities

## Spec Scope

1. **Home Assistant API Client** - Implement Spring Boot REST client for Home Assistant API with proper authentication and error handling
2. **WebSocket Connection Management** - Establish and maintain WebSocket connections for real-time event monitoring with automatic reconnection
3. **Event Data Processing** - Process and store Home Assistant events in PostgreSQL and InfluxDB with proper data modeling
4. **Configuration Management** - Secure storage and management of Home Assistant connection credentials using Spring Boot configuration
5. **Connection Health Monitoring** - Implement health checks and monitoring for Home Assistant connection status using Spring Boot Actuator

## Out of Scope

- User interface for Home Assistant management (will be addressed in Basic Web Interface spec)
- Advanced pattern recognition and AI analysis (will be addressed in Basic Pattern Recognition spec)
- Authentication system for TappHA users (will be addressed in User Authentication spec)
- Real-time dashboard and visualization (will be addressed in Basic Web Interface spec)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Spring Boot service that successfully connects to Home Assistant API and WebSocket with proper error handling and reconnection logic
2. Secure configuration management system for storing Home Assistant credentials with encryption
3. Event data storage in PostgreSQL and InfluxDB with proper schema design for future pattern analysis
4. Health monitoring endpoints that report connection status and event processing metrics
