## 2024-12-19: Standards Compliance Alignment

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

TappHA will be developed using the Agent OS standards-compliant tech stack: Spring Boot 3.3+ (Java 21 LTS) for backend, React 19 with TypeScript 5 for frontend, and OpenAI GPT-4o with pgvector for AI capabilities, replacing the initially planned Python/FastAPI stack.

### Context

The Agent OS standards define a specific technology stack that all projects must follow for consistency, maintainability, and best practices. The standards specify Spring Boot 3.3+ (Java 21 LTS) for backend services, React 19 with TypeScript 5 for frontend, and specific AI/ML technologies including OpenAI GPT-4o and pgvector.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Python/FastAPI Stack (Original Plan)**
   - Pros: Rapid development, familiar to many developers, good for AI/ML
   - Cons: Not compliant with Agent OS standards, different patterns from other projects

2. **Spring Boot Stack (Standards Compliant)**
   - Pros: Fully compliant with Agent OS standards, enterprise-grade, consistent with other projects
   - Cons: Requires Java expertise, longer development time for some features

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Pros: Best of both worlds, flexibility
   - Cons: Increased complexity, maintenance overhead, not standards compliant

### Rationale

The decision to align with Agent OS standards was based on:
- **Consistency**: Ensures all Agent OS projects follow the same patterns
- **Maintainability**: Standardized tech stack reduces maintenance overhead
- **Best Practices**: Standards incorporate proven enterprise patterns
- **Team Efficiency**: Developers familiar with one project can work on others
- **Long-term Success**: Standards are designed for scalability and reliability

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Full compliance with Agent OS standards
- Consistent development patterns across projects
- Enterprise-grade architecture from the start
- Better integration with existing Agent OS tooling
- Improved maintainability and scalability

**Negative:**
- Requires Java/Spring Boot expertise
- Slightly longer initial development time
- Need to adapt Home Assistant integration patterns for Spring Boot

## 2024-12-19: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

TappHA will be developed as an intelligent AI-driven software solution that integrates with existing Home Assistant installations to provide proactive, real-time home automation management. The product will focus on advanced pattern recognition, autonomous automation management, and intelligent recommendations for Home Assistant power users.

### Context

The smart home automation market is growing rapidly, with Home Assistant being a popular open-source platform. However, users face challenges with manual automation management, limited pattern recognition, and reactive rather than proactive automation systems. TappHA addresses these pain points by providing AI-driven intelligence that can analyze behavioral patterns and autonomously optimize automation systems.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Home Assistant Add-on**
   - Pros: Simpler development, familiar to users
   - Cons: Limited intelligence, requires manual configuration, doesn't solve core problems

2. **Cloud-based AI Platform**
   - Pros: Scalable, advanced AI capabilities
   - Cons: Privacy concerns, dependency on internet, potential data security issues

3. **Local-only Solution**
   - Pros: Privacy-focused, works offline
   - Cons: Limited AI capabilities, requires significant local computing resources

### Rationale

The decision to create TappHA as a local-first, AI-driven solution was based on:
- Strong market demand for intelligent automation management
- Privacy concerns of Home Assistant users
- Technical feasibility of local AI processing
- Competitive advantage through autonomous management capabilities

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Addresses real pain points in the Home Assistant ecosystem
- Provides significant value through automation optimization
- Creates competitive advantage through AI-driven intelligence
- Targets a growing market with high user engagement

**Negative:**
- Complex technical implementation requiring AI/ML expertise
- Requires significant development time and resources
- May face resistance from users who prefer manual control
- Needs substantial data collection for effective AI training
