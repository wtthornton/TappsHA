# Create a new lesson file
cp ../templates/lesson-template.md YYYY-MM-DD-lesson-title.md
```

### 2. Review Lessons
Conduct regular reviews using the review template:
```bash
# Use the review template
cp ../process/review-template.md YYYY-MM-DD-review.md
```

### 3. Integrate Lessons
Follow the integration process to update standards:
```bash
# Follow the integration checklist
cp ../process/integration-checklist.md integration-checklist.md
```

### 4. Monitor Analytics
