# Agent OS Lessons Learned Framework

## Overview

The Agent OS Lessons Learned Framework is a comprehensive system for capturing, analyzing, and applying knowledge gained during project development to continuously improve the Agent OS framework and development practices.

## Quick Start

### 1. Capture a Lesson
Use the capture template to document a lesson learned:
```bash
# Navigate to the appropriate category
cd .agent-os/lessons-learned/categories/[category]

# Create a new lesson file
cp ../templates/lesson-template.md YYYY-MM-DD-lesson-title.md
```

### 2. Review Lessons
Conduct regular reviews using the review template:
```bash
# Use the review template
cp ../process/review-template.md YYYY-MM-DD-review.md
```

### 3. Integrate Lessons
Follow the integration process to update standards:
```bash
# Follow the integration checklist
cp ../process/integration-checklist.md integration-checklist.md
```
